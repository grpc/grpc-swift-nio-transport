/// A client transport which wraps an existing SwiftNIO `Channel`.
///
/// You can use this if you already have a connected `Channel` that you'd like to use as a gRPC
/// client connection. This is helpful if, for example, you wish to tunnel gRPC inside another
/// protocol. This approach has limitations: as the pre-connected `Channel` is provided to gRPC
/// it isn't possible to transparently reconnect should the connection close. As such this transport
/// offers fewer features than its regular NIO based counterparts.
///
/// ## Providing a suitable Channel
///
/// The transport will add a number of channel handlers to the end of the pipeline of the provided
/// channel. You must ensure that the final channel handler (before being passed into the transport)
/// uses `ByteBuffer` as its `InboundIn` and `OutboundOut` types.
///
/// If you require TLS then it's your responsibility to ensure that the channel is already
/// appropriately configured to use it.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// By providing a channel to this transport you hand ownership of it to the transport. The
/// transport therefore becomes responsible for closing the channel at the appropriate point
/// in time.
